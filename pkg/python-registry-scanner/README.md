# python-registry-scanner

Scripts are created to scan an insecure private Docker registry at port `5000` with the basic authentication from `brittanym/registry:2.0`.

## quick start
To start, clone this repository.

### go
- see the [registry-scanner](https://github.com/britdm/http-registry-scanner) project

### python
- In the local directory run `python registry-scanner.py`
- tbd: PYC support

## future goals
- Enable input for variables `registry url`, `username`, and `password`.
- Binary files to simplify installation and use of the scanner.
